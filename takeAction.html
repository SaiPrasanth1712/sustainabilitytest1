<p class="para1">The results of this assessment can be used for more than disclosing and reporting on the organization's sustainability performance. They can also be used to guide if / where the organization plans to improve.</p>

  <h1 class="purple1">Prioritization for Action</h1>
  <p class="para1">
It is unlikely that an organization will undertake improvements on its scores all at once. Several stakeholder-related factors usually are taken into consideration when determining which should be prioritized for action. If particular issues are important to key stakeholders, they are important to the organization and should be prioritized for action.<br>

* Issues which the organization's senior management deem to be critical to achieving the organization's purpose and strategic plan / goals. <br>

* Issues of particular interest to lender's / banker's because they affect the organization's risk profile and eligibility for preferential treatment. 
  (e.g., sustainability-linked loans may give weight to climate change related issues.)<br>

* Issues that important customers / buyers deem to be high-priority ESG issues, as emphasized in their requirement to disclose your organization's enterprise-level sustainability impacts, in their requests for proposals (RFPs).
  (e.g. sustainable procurement requires suppliers to disclose their enterprise-level sustainability performance)<br>

* Issues that could significantly affect the organization's image / reputation / brand value, or already have.<br>

* Issues that are of most interest to investors, depending on the organization's industry sector. 
  (e.g., as indicated by the SASB Materiality Map, at the link below) <br>

* Issues of most interest to governments, foundations, and raters / rankers.<br>
