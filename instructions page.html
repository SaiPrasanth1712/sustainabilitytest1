<h2>Overall Guidance</h2>
<div id="border">
	<ul>
		<li>Answer the questions in any sequence: Use the Next and Previous buttons in the tool bars to navigate through the questions, replacing the sample answers in the yellow cells with your choices and data. The small progress bar in the left-hand corner of the bottom tool bar shows where you are in the question set.</li>
		<li>Estimates: If you are not sure of the answer, estimates are okay. Most of the quantified data is rounded to the nearest 10%. Just be sure to document your estimation methodology, data sources, and assumptions so that they can be improved later and could be assured / verified by a third party.</li>
		<li>Tailoring the tool: Users are encouraged to treat this tool as theirs, and modify / tailor it to suit their purposes.</li>
		<li>Saving and sharing results: See the Finish sheet at the end for how to do this.</li>

<h2>Collaboration / Sharing</h2>
<div id="border">
	<p>This online version was created using SpreadsheetConverter (SSC) from a special SSC-ready version of the BSAT Excel workbook. Its master copy is hosted in the SSC cloud. When you access it and use it, you actually work with a copy of it in your browser, not with the master copy in the SSC cloud. All your input and changes are stored in your browser, magically and automatically. You may need help from colleagues with answers to some questions. That collaboration can be accomplished several ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Email: Send screen captures or copies of the questions with which you need help to your appropriate colleagues, with guidance on where you would like their help. Then, consolidate their replies into your master copy. 
		</li>
		<li>Zoom: Share your master copy of this workbook on your screen in a Zoom call with your colleagues and update it with them, live. Or, do separate 1-on-1 calls with them, focusing on the areas where you need their help.</li>
		<li>Meet with them: COVID-19 protocols permitting, this approach still works, too.â˜º</li>
		<li>Online collaboration: If you want to share this SSC-created online versin of BSAT with colleagues, you need to create a unique version of the tool in the SSC cloud. Then, you and your colleagues can access it and yourcombined changes are automatically stored in your shared unique version. Think of it as an SSC version of Google Sheets. Instructions on how to create and share a unique copy of this online tool are available at the SSC link, below. The referenced "Real-time Sync" has already been activated, as indicated by the Real-time Sync button in the right-hand corner of the toolbar at the bottom of all screens.</li>
