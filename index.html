<h2>About</h2>
<div id="div1">
  <p class="first">This tool enables an organization to assess its progress toward causing no harm to people and the environment, as well as its positive impacts on people and the environment. 
</p>

</div>
<h2> Intended Users </h2>
<div id="div2">
  <p>This is a <strong>comprehensive, generic tool</strong>. It is designed for use by any-size organization, in any sector, in any country. It may be especially helpful for small- and medium-sized enterprises <strong>(SMEs)</strong>, and large organizations with minimal or no sustainability staff.<br><br>

  The tool assesses performance on the <strong>core sustainability issues</strong> that are common to most popular sustainability reporting frameworks and standards, as shown in this comparison:</p>
<div id="div6">
<a href="https://sustainabilityadvantage.com/assessments/overview/">Comparision of Sustainability frameworks</a> </div>
</div>
<h2>Accommodates Three Frameworks</h2>
<div id="div5">
<p> The tool assesses an organization's progress on reducing / eliminating its harmful impacts on the environment, its employees, and society. It also give bonus points if the organization is being regenerative, either directly or indirectly, through its products, services and donations that amplify othersâ€™ positive impacts or help others cause less harm. It automatically expresses the results three ways:

<ol>
  <li>As scores on progress toward science-based goals for <strong>core sustainability / ESG issues.</strong> <br>
    These issues arise at the organization's impact points, as shown in the figure below. 
    Note: ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) is used as a shorthand synonym for ""sustainability."</li><br>

    <li>As scores on contributions to the 17 <strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</strong><br>
    Scores on ESG issues are used as proxies for scores on their aligned, primary SDGs.</li><br>

    <li>As scores on impacts on the 3 <strong>non-financial capitals</strong> (natural, human, and social). <br>
   Scores on ESG issues are used as proxies for scores on aligned natural, human and social capitals.</li><br> 

   Organizations can express their sustainability scores in whichever framework's terminology (ESG, SDG or non-financial capitals) is most appropriate for their purposes, or preferred by the stakeholder that is requesting the disclosure. If scores on the SDGs or the non-financial capitals are not of interest, those tabs can be ignored or deleted.
</ol>
